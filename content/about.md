I am a software developer with a passion for creating custom Shopify themes and apps. With seven years of experience working with clients and contributing to the Shopify theme store, I've developed a deep understanding of how to build beautiful and functional online storefronts that truly stand out.

In addition to my work with Shopify, I'm also a creative coder who loves to experiment with generative art and explore the intersection of technology and art. Whether I'm working on a new Shopify theme or building a piece of art with code, I always strive to push the boundaries of what's possible and find innovative solutions to complex challenges.

One of my core values as a developer is a commitment to open-source software and tools. I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, and I'm always looking for ways to give back to the community by creating open-source resources that help others build better software.
