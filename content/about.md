I am a software developer with a passion for creating Shopify themes and apps. With seven years of experience working with clients and contributing to the Shopify theme store, I've developed a deep understanding of how to build beautiful and functional online storefronts that truly stand out.

When I'm not working on Shopify projects, I love exploring how code can be used to make art. Creating generative art is a creative outlet for me that allows me to learn new techniques and practive my skills.
