Stops people from straight up copying it.

Encourages people to actually learn how it works instead of just copying and pasting.

Having a conversation and actually explaining how the algorithm works will help the learner and myself.
Explaining how the code works gives me a deeper understanding and allows me to expand on my design.
When the algorithm is explained to someone there's less of a chance they will just copy my work and instead they will take the core rules of the algorithm and modify it to create their own design.

I have no problem with sharing code examples and snippets to help someone learn, but sharing the finished project has much less value to me.

Of course I see the value in sharing code. I use, develop, and rely on open source software everyday in my generative work and day job. Sharing the process and explaining how a piece of code works takes time and energy, sometimes that time and energy just isn't available.

This is just what works for me, and this isn't how I approach all of my work.
